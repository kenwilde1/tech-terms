## What is Tech Terms?

Tech Terms is a CRUD application that allows users to contribute term definitions to a repository. All terms can then be searched, edited or deleted. When a user comes across a tech term they don't understand, they can search the acronym on Tech Terms and get a definition. Tech Terms also provides other resources to learn more about the term.
